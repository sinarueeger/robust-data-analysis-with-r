This report is about **meteorites**, where they fell and when they fell. Data comes from the Meteoritical Society by way of NASA and was contributed to [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-11) (week 24) by [Malin Axelsson](https://twitter.com/malinfax).

If you want to read more about the classification of meteorites, see [this Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification) entry. 


# Import data

The `meteorites` dataset was downloaded from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-11/meteorites.csv` and stored as `meteorites.csv`. 

```{r}

dat_raw <- readr::read_csv("../data/meteorites.csv")

```

# Tidy data

There is no data tidying needed (see [R4DS tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)), because each variable having its own column, each observation its own row, and each value its own cell. 



# Transform data

```{r}
dat <- dat_raw %>% 
## 1) Remove rows that have year as NA
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>%
## 2) remove name_type Relict cases
  filter(name_type != "Relict") %>%
## 3) remove mass min
  filter(mass > 0) %>%
## 4) remove years with more than 2019
  filter(year <= 2019) %>%
## 5) create a variable century
  mutate(century = droplevels(cut(year, seq(from = 0, to = 2019, by = 100), right = FALSE, dig.lab = 4))) %>% 
## 6) create a variable decade
  mutate(decade = droplevels(cut(year, seq(from = 0, to = 2019, by = 10), right = FALSE, dig.lab = 4)))

```

# Descriptive analysis

```{r}
skimr::skim(dat) %>% 
  skimr::kable(format = 'html') 

```


## Histogram

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat) + geom_histogram(aes(year)) + xlim(1800, NA)
```

## Scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat) + geom_line(aes(year, mass)) + xlim(1800, NA)
```


## Map

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
ggplot(data = dat) + geom_point(aes(long, lat))
ggplot(data = dat) + geom_point(aes(long, lat)) + facet_wrap(~ century)
```



```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

theme_set(
  theme_void()
  )

## basic
world_map <- map_data("world")
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill="lightgray", colour = "white") + 
  geom_point(data = dat, aes(long, lat), color="red", alpha=0.5)
```


Animation
```{r eval=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, include=FALSE}

world_map <- map_data("world")
ggplot(data = dat) +
  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill="lightgray", colour = "white") + 
  geom_point(data = dat, aes(long, lat), color="red", alpha=0.5) +
  transition_states(decade, transition_length = 40, state_length = 40) + 
  labs(title = "Decade: {closest_state}") +
  NULL

```




# Model

Fit a prediction model that takes year, location and mass into account

# Export

Store transformed data

```{r}

## as text file
readr::write_delim(dat, path = "../out/meteorites_transformed.csv", delim = " " )

## as Excel file
?write_xlsx
write_xlsx(dat, path = "../out/meteorites_transformed.xlsx")

```
