This repository contains the slides, handbook, and exercises for the workshop _Robust data analysis: an introduction to R_ at the [_Open Science in Practice_](http://osip2019.epfl.ch/) Summer School at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. The workshop aims at people that have rarely/not used R in the past, and that do the majority of their analyses in spreadsheet-like tools like Excel.
