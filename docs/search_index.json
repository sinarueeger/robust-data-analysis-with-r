The basic idea is, to have exposure to the language. Learn with isolated &amp; digestable examples First, make sure to not overwhelm yourself with trying to learn everything all at once. Better is, to stick to isolated examples. For example, instead of trying to tackle the whole data analysis workflow all at once, try to become better at data reshaping first. And instead of using your own data, with which you might first struggle with the data import, use the dataset that R already provides. 4.1.1 Look for a steady stream of data or exercises The TidyTuesday data supply was created to have a weekly data analysis workflow challenge. Since their start in 2018, they now have ?? datasets. Watch out for code puzzles: advent of code / tidies of march by Irene Steves 4.1.2 Watch recordings Many small &amp; large R conferences record their speakers: - New York R conference recordings - R conference recordings - RStudio conference recordings rOpenSci community call archive Screencasts https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1166083585771802626 https://twitter.com/nic_crane/status/1150496452218671106 (Nic Crane) 4.1.3 Read blogposts Weekly supply of blogposts here: https://rweekly.org/ 4.2 Embrace imperfection Programming is an iterative process 1 solutions 4.2.1 Exploit imperfection Look at each others code Refactor your code Review each others code Pair programming 4.3 How to ask for help 1. Look online Stack Overflow (SO) RStudio Community 2. Create a reproducible example create a reproducbile example using a small R available dataset (e.g. iris) install.packages(\"reprex\") select code and run reprex https://github.com/jules32/useR-2019-keynote/tree/gh-pages/img 3. Ask on SO, twitter, RStudio help C+P r bit into one of the follwing streams: Ask within a community (R-Ladies, R4DS) https://community.rstudio.com/ https://stackoverflow.com/ Twitter using the #rstats hashtag: 4.4 Become part of the community 4.4.1 R-Ladies 4.4.2 Join an online community R for Data Science online learning community: https://www.rfordatasci.com/ (slack, tidytuesday): https://rfordatascience.slack.com/ R-ladies Slack: https://www.rfordatasci.com/ French-speaking r-grrr Slack (+ online ressources) 4.4.3 rOpenSci Attend a community call (archive).
