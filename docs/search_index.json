This chapter covers four learning strategies, a mindset, how you can ask others for help](#how-to-ask-for-help) and where to find other R users. 5.1 Learning strategies Here is a selection of different learning strategies, that can be combined or applied on their own. The basic idea is, to have exposure to the language, similarly as you do, when you learn a natural language. Learn with isolated &amp; digestable examples First, make sure to not overwhelm yourself with trying to learn everything at once. Better is, to stick to isolated examples. For example, instead of trying to tackle the whole data analysis workflow all at once, try to become better at data reshaping first. And instead of using your own data, with which you might first struggle to import into R, use the dataset that R already provides1. Look for a steady stream of data or exercises Such a weekly data stream is TidyTuesday run by the R for Data Science online learning community. TidyTuesday data supply was created to have “toy” data to practice data visualization and basic data wrangling in R. Since their start in 2018 they have now over 70 datasets. These datasets are “tamed”, but not always tidy. Watch out for an upcominig code puzzle initiative similar to advent of code by Irene Steves. Watch recordings Many small &amp; large R conferences record their speakers: New York R conference recordings useR! conference recordings RStudio conference recordings rOpenSci has monthly community calls. Some R users record their R usage with screencasts, for example: Nic Crane Dan Quintana David Robinson Read blogposts The best resource for new blogposts or any other R news is Rweekly, a community-driven initiative that provides a curated weekly newsletter. 5.2 Embrace imperfection Learning a programming language can be discouraging. Things might not work from start, and it will constantly feel like everyone else is more proficient and ahead of you. Keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect R-script. Of course, there are best-practices, but writing an R-script will always be a interative process, where you start and after some weeks you might have learned something, and you want to replace your old code with an improved version. Another reason to not strive for perfection, is that R offers a variety of solutions for one problem. For example, there are many different ways how to import data into R, or how to subset your data. Therefore it is likely that your R-scripts will look different from any of your colleagues. Instead of feeling discouraged, you should embrace imperfection and take it as a driving force to learn more. Exploit imperfection You can even exploit imperfection with three tips: Look &amp; review each others code: Ask your colleagues at work if they would like to spend 30 minutes looking at your code. In return, you can do the same for them. This will not only give you (and them) insight into how other people write R code, but also force you to produce reproducible R-script (otherwise your colleague will not be able to run your code). Rewrite your code: You will constantly improve your R skills. Do not hesitate to rewrite your own R code (while keeping the output the same). This ideally goes hand in hand with unit tests. Look at open source code: Watch out for public repositories (for example this one). This is another great way to see how others write R scripts and how they make sure that their repository is reproducible. See also screencasts mentioned earlier. 5.3 How to ask for help What do you do if you have a question? For example, you get an error message, something is not working as intended or you simply want to know if there is any other possibility? There are three steps you should keep in mind2: Browse the web first Create a reproducible example Post your question online Look online First, scan the web by simply copy and pasting the error message. This will most likely direct you to the following two websites: Stack Overflow RStudio Community Sometimes your question or error message is too specific, and you might want to describe the problem in words when searching. Create a reproducible example If you cannot find any existing solution to your problem, you can post your question online3. To increase the likelihood of getting an answer and feedback, you should provide a reproducible example. Here is the workflow of doing this: First, you try to reproduce the error message with a dataset within R, e.g. the iris dataset. The iris dataset is relatively small and contains a mixture of numeric and factor variables. This is a good dataset for many use cases. Very often, working out a small example will already solve your problem. Solely, by thinking about the problem, you will find the solution yourself. If not, install the reprex package. Then highlight the code of your reproducible example, choose in the Addins Reprex selection (see video here). Artwork by (???) Ask on your question online Once you have your reproducible example, post it in one of the follwing places: Ask within an online community. This is a good place to start because protected through a Code of Conduct and because there people part of the community are learners too (hence, can put themselves into your shoes). Ask the RStudio community. Ask on Stack Overflow. Ask on twitter using the #rstats hashtag. 5.4 Become part of the community Sometimes it feels as if the R community is one big family with different, overlapping communities. R-Ladies R-Ladies is a world-wide organisation to promote gender diversity in the R community. As a diversity initiative4, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. At the moment, there are 167 R-Ladies chapters (local R user groups) in 47 countries. R-Ladies has a Code of Conduct that ensures that R-Ladies meetups and online spaces are safe places. For women and gender minorities R-Ladies offers: Slack Abstract / Scholarship review process R-Ladies directory Join an online community R for Data Science online learning community has a Slack, is on (Twitter: ???)(https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity) and provides the weekly TidyTuesday datasets. French-speaking r-grrr Slack (+ online ressources) rOpenSci rOpenSci fosters a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. The non-profit initiative founded in 2011 builds software with a community of users and developers, and educates scientists about transparent research practices. A good place to get familiar with rOpenSci is, to attend or re-watch a community call (archive). You can also contribute via the shinyapp. Join an R meetup R meetups and R user groups are great places to meet other people and to exchange knowledge! There are several R meetups in the lemanic region: R-Ladies in Lausanne RUG in Geneva R lunches in Geneva adminR If you are a women or gender minority and work remotely or are in another sense “remote”, there is R-Ladies Remote (coffee chats, journal club). You can find the full list of RUG’s here and for R-Ladies here. Write blogposts Writing blogposts can be a fun way of learning R. For example, to start, you could document your journey of learning R. Even if you do not have a blog, you can start with gist.github.com and later move to blogdown. Do not forget to submit your blogpost to rweekly! Engage on Twitter Twitter is a fun place to see new R features and learn about R. Here are four fun handles to follow: Mara Averick Maëlle Salmon R for the rest of us WeAreRLadies Type data() into the console to see “in-house” data in R.↩ Maëlle Salmon wrote a great blog post about Where to get help with your R question?.↩ It is important to make your question public to everyone, so others will be able to look up the solution later.↩ RForwards is another initiative to increase participation of women and other under-represented groups in the R community.↩ "]
