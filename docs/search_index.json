Or more precisely: The R Project for Statistical Computing. It is a free software and anyone can contribute to the software by creating a package. Just celebrated its 25 year anniversary While it was developed to do mainly statistical computations (e.g. regression models) and data visualisation, it has now a lot of additional features that are somehow related to statistics, but could stand on its own. Comes with basic/default packages, but there are over 13‚Äô000 R-packages that can be installed through CRAN or repositories like github. 2.1 Capabilities of R Extract from presentation by Heidi Seibold Beyond being a calculator and being able to estimate statistical models, R can help us to organise the data analysis workflow better. Communication of results through literate programming: RMarkdown (blogdown, bookdown, this!) through a web application: shiny Data visualisation: gganimate, ggplot2, ggmap APIs access an API (So the API is a layer of code that sits between the database and most database users.) produce an API (also these resouces (h/t Sharla Gelfand)) Importing different types of data that is not txt automise computation speed up computation run on a server talk to git enforces standards (because you need to work a certan way with a certain structure) 2.2 Constantly improving There are things R is good at and tasks that R is not that good at. And this has changed over time. Because R is an open source project, the language is constantly evolving &amp; improving. 2.3 Technical bits: Functions and libraries Programming typically works like this: you apply a function to an object. You could also say that you apply an action (a verb) to an object (a noun). Excel also has functions: these are the tabs, and the object would be your active sheet. This is an important propertiy, because a chain of such verbs can create a programming script. If you hear the term library or package, then this is simply a collection of functions. In opensource languages, anyone can contribute a package. And we will do this later. Example with plot: function, arguments, pacakage, libraary, objects 2.4 R vs. RStudio 2.4.1 R https://www.r-project.org/ core anyone can contribute a package Show print screen / website Download here: https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/ Website of R Project Screenshot from R Project Website 2.4.2 RStudio Website of RStudio Screenshot of RStudio User Interface for R Works for any computer system (MacOSx, Linux, Windows) Desktop version is free) if you are an individual user develop a lot of new packages, e.g. shiny anything between teaching and solutions for production Where are things in RStudio?: https://twitter.com/RLadiesNCL/status/1138812826917724160/photo/1 Download here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 2.5 Hierarchy of best practices documentation (lintr) run all script (usethis) version control (gitr) unit tests and sanity checks (testthat, assertr) write functions, package them and tell everyone (devtools, blogdown) continuous integration (devtools, blogdown) makefile (caching) (drake) binder (holepunch) 2.6 R in the wild Fun stuff in R: Thread on Twitter by Amelia McNamara Data Journalism: Roger Federer @ SRF The evolution of a ggplot: Blogpost by Cederic Scherer Research compendium: DirectEffBCGPolicyChange by Sam Abbott Mendelian Randomisation in AD Fat distribution GWAS Animations: https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs#tidy-animated-verbs Fun stuff like Memes: https://djnavarro.net/post/memes-are-valid-social-commentary/ video, animation, presentation, website, write to excel ‚Ä¶ 2.7 Getting started Install R : On a computer: via RStudio or R project. Or (easier) use R in browser: rdrr.io/snippets/ (no login required) or Studio Cloud (login with google or githu baccount). ‚ÅâÔ∏è Come up with a question you want to answer. Get your hands on data üîÄ Take part in TidyTuesday. 2.8 More Some history of R How to install R and RStudio To use git, github and RStudio, checkout Happy git with R. "]
