This involves data import, data wrangling, statistical data analysis, and turning the results into something that is readable by a human. Grolemund &amp; Wickham, 2017 presented this as a diagram. From R for Data Science by Grolemund &amp; Wickham, 2017. The diagram makes clear, that the data analysis workflow consists of different modules that depend on the previous one, and that there is directionality in the flow: an entrance, iteration and en exit. That only tidy data is useful for the analysis, that wrangling is linear, but that understanding is an iterative process, that the analysis is a portable &amp; isolated box. Lastly, sharing of results is key. 1.1 Data analysis in reality In reality, data wrangling is rarely linear, instead a forth and back. Therefore, flexibility in moving through these modules with software + automation is key. 1.2 Requirements to data analysis software What else is important for software? Software should should be used by others (otherwise, sharing code is difficult), be continuously developed &amp; improved (new data formats, new communication formats), easy to use (high-level language), Translation of modules to Code, make it easy to exchange results with others. 1.3 More If you are interested in the data analysis workflow, read the R for Data Science book. And if you are interested in another formalisation of data analysis have a look at recent work by Hicks &amp; Peng, 2019. Elements &amp; Principles lays out the elements that build a data analysis, and the principles in assembling them. "]
