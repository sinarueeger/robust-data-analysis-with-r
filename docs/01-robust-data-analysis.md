# Data Analysis

What is data anlysis and what makes it robust?


## Process to analyse data

- wickham+grolemund: circle (Wickham & Grolemund, 201)
- Elements & Principles (Hicks & Peng, 2019)


### Loop
(wickham + grolemund)


### Elements & Principles
(hicks + peng)


### Overlap between both approaches

- tidy data
- reproducibility
- flow + exit the flow or repeat the flow, modify
- share results (which can then be used as an input again)


## Requirements to a Software

- reproducible
- used by others
- continuously development
- high-level
- exchange results with others


## Automation

Programming is essentially an automation of a process
- for repeatable tasks (like adding two numbers)
- scalable (many times repeating )
- complicated tasks (variable selection)
- where precision is needed (adding two decimals)
- reusing of frameworks (long code into functions)
- reproduce it

A side effect of a certain automation also brings reproducibility.
