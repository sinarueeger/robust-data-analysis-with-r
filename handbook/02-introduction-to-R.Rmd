# Introduction of R

## Capabilities of R

(show diagram from heidi seibold)
- It has been developed to do statistical data analysis
- Data insights
- simple calculations
- advanced statistical models
- statistical data analysis
- exchange with others
- [access API](https://medium.com/epfl-extension-school/an-illustrated-introduction-to-apis-10f8000313b9) (_So the API is a layer of code that sits between the database and most database users._)
- [produce an API](https://medium.com/tmobile-tech/r-can-api-c184951a24a3) (also [these resouces (h/t Sharla Gelfand)](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/1157794847438364679))
- read in data
- automise
- speed up
- run on a server
- talk to github
- enforces standards (because you need to work a certan way with a certain structure)


### R has three things that I believe makes it special

- APIs
- RMarkdown (shiny, html, websites, ... )
- Plotting, anything visual

## Constantly improving

There are things R is good at and tasks that R is not that good at. And this has changed over time. Because R is an open source project, the language is constantly evolving & improving. 


## Technical bits: Functions and libraries

- Programming typically works like this: you apply a function to an object. 

- You could also say that you apply an action (a verb) to an object (a noun). 

- Excel also has functions: these are the tabs, and the object would be your active sheet. 

- This is an important propertiy, because a chain of such verbs can create a programming script. 

- If you hear the term library or package, then this is simply a collection of functions. In opensource languages, anyone can contribute a package. And we will do this later. 

- Example with plot: function, arguments, pacakage, libraary, objects

## R vs. RStudio

### R

- core
- anyone can contribute a package
- Show print screen / website


### RStudio

- UI
- works for any platform
- costs for companies
- solutions for servers
- develop a lot of new packages
- anything between teaching and solutions for production
- shiny
- git : https://happygitwithr.com/
- Where are things in RStudio?: https://twitter.com/RLadiesNCL/status/1138812826917724160/photo/1


## Hierarchy of best practices

1. documentation
1. run all script
1. version control
1. unit tests and sanity checks
1. write functions, package them and tell everyone
1. continuous integration
1. makefile (caching)
