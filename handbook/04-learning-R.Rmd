# Learning R

## Learning strategies

Here is a selection of different learning strategies, and the best is, if you can apply them all. The basic idea is, to have exposure to the language. 

<!-------
- Learn with isolated & digestable examples
- Sources of examples: tidytuesday, advent of code / tidies of march (irene steves)
- Listen to podcasts or watch videos: https://www.rstats.nyc/2019/nyr/ / community calls: https://ropensci.org/commcalls/
- Make use of pen + paper
-------->

### Learn with isolated & digestable examples {-}
First, make sure to not overwhelm yourself with trying to learn everything all at once. Better is, to stick to isolated examples. For example, instead of trying to tackle the whole data analysis workflow all at once, try to become better at data reshaping first. And instead of using your own data, with which you might first struggle with the data import, use the dataset that R already provides. 


### Look for a steady stream of data or exercises

The [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data supply was created to have a weekly data analysis workflow challenge. Since their start in 2018, they now have ?? datasets.

### Watch recordings

Many small & large R conferences record their speakers:
- New York R conference [recordings](https://www.rstats.nyc/2019/nyr/)
- R conference [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_R5smHVXRYGhZYDJsnXTwg)
- RStudio conference [recordings](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019)

## Embrace imperfection

Programming is

1. an iterative process

2. > 1 solutions

### Exploit imperfection

- Look at each others code

- Refactor your code

- Review each others code

- Pair programming


## How to ask for help

### 1. Look online {-}

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (SO)
- [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)


### 2. Create a reproducible example {-}

1. create a reproducbile example using a small R available dataset (e.g. iris)
1. `install.packages("reprex")`
1. select code and run reprex

<!---- this will often already guide you to the solution -------> 


### 3. Ask on SO, twitter, RStudio help {-}

C+P r bit into one of the follwing streams:

- Ask within a community (R-Ladies, R4DS)

- https://community.rstudio.com/

- https://stackoverflow.com/

- Twitter using the `#rstats` hashtag:

- If its a bug: file an issue on github

Why not writing directly to the maintainer? Because online helps
